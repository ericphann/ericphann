## 👋 Hello there!
My name is __Eric Phann__. I’m a data scientist with an affinity for language. My research and professional interests are somewhere within the intersection of technology and linguistics.
 
Please feel free to reach out -- I am always happy to connect! :blush:

## :sparkles: About Me

I have a strong background in linguistics and foreign languages. I'm currently learning a lot about natural language processing (NLP) techniques and large-language models (LLMs). I'm interested in researching the dynamic between LLMs and sociolinguistics.
